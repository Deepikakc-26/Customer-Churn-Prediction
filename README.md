# 📉 Customer Churn Prediction (Machine Learning)

This project predicts customer churn using machine learning by analyzing customer behavior, usage patterns, payment history, and engagement signals. The goal is to identify at-risk customers early and support targeted retention strategies.

# 🚀 Project Overview

Predicts whether a customer will churn using ML models.

Uses feature engineering based on recency, frequency, monetary value, engagement drop, support issues, and payment failures.

Supports industries like Telecom, Banking, E-commerce, and SaaS.

Helps businesses reduce churn, improve customer lifetime value, and increase revenue retention.

# 🧠 Approach & Features

Data preprocessing and cleaning

Feature engineering (RFM metrics, trend features, usage patterns)

Model training with Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost, and Ensemble models

Risk scoring (Low → Critical risk)

Insights into top churn predictors

Business strategies based on churn reasons

🤖 Models Used

Logistic Regression

Random Forest

XGBoost

Neural Networks

Ensemble Model

These models achieve 80–90% accuracy depending on algorithm and features.

📈 Key Insights

High monthly charges → high churn risk

Month-to-month contracts → most likely to churn

Low engagement, declining usage → strong early warning

Payment failures, downgrades, support complaints → churn triggers

Tenure and service type strongly influence churn probability

📊 Risk Segmentation
